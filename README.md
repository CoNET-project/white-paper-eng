# CONET White Paper

The Internet has become an indispensable part of our lives. It has become the medium we communicate with, access digital media, shop and access our finances. A large amount of stable and reliable infrastructure has been create to support it, but at the same time is being leveraged by the companies that control it.&#x20;

"Data is the new oil." - Clive Humby

The internet was not created with security or privacy in mind. Any attempt to add privacy or security has had to been "patched" in, not solving root issues the Internet creates due to its design. As tech companies grow, they look for ways of increasing their revenues by mining data from users to use themselves, or even sell to others, and it has become a digital gold mine. The majority of users are protected by government policy and regulation that mostly affect infrastructure providers, but it has been proven again and again that they can't be trusted. While anonymization tools exist, most users don't know or care about them and most are too technical to benefit the average user.

With the rise of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum in recent years, users have been shown the benefits of decentralized networks. These are systems where users have pseudo-anonymity and can interact with the networks in a trustless and permissionless way. These networks are impossible to take down, due to being decentralized, and no single entity has the power to censor interactions and track user data.&#x20;

People have pinned their hopes of transforming the Internet using blockchain technology, and the concept of Web3 was born. When comparing blockchain technology with the Internet, the disadvantages are obvious. The amount of data stored on the internet is staggering and blockchain is a notoriously expensive way to store data. How can we take advantage of the privacy benefits of blockchain with the infinitely scalable data storage of the internet?

CONET intends to provide a privacy-first network infrastructure based on Internet and decentralized blockchain technology, achieve fast and high throughput of the Internet, and achieve the goal of getting rid of all the privacy constraints of the existing Internet on Web3.
