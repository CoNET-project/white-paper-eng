# README

The Internet has developed to now and has become an indispensable part of our lives. And a large amount of stable and reliable infrastructure has been created on it. At the same time, centralized Big-Tech giants have almost monopolized all resources on the Internet and can even do whatever they want. User privacy issues have become the hardest hit area. Reliance on government policy regulation and the promises of infrastructure operators can no longer be trusted. In recent years, the great success of Bitcoin and Ethereum has allowed people to see the power of decentralization, based on permissionless and trustless Code is low.&#x20;

People have pinned their hopes of transforming the Internet on blockchain technology, and the concept of Web3 was born. When comparing blockchain technology with the Internet, the disadvantages are obvious. It is technically impossible to load the Internet into Web3. How can Web3 loaded on the Internet get rid of the constraints of the Internet on Web3?&#x20;

CONET intends to provide a privacy-first network infrastructure based on de-Internet and centralized technology, achieve fast and high throughput of the Internet, and achieve the goal of getting rid of all the constraints of the existing Internet on Web3
