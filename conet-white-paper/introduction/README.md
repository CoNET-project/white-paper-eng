# Introduction

CONET is made up of 2 distinct products; CONET Privacy Layer and the CONET Blockchain.

CONET Privacy Layer is a virtual private network infrastructure layer on the Internet. It uses wallet addresses as identifiers for private communication, in lieu of IP addresses, once inside the network, and is also the layer that provides anonymous routing of user communications.

CONET Blockchain is a Proof-of-Stake Ethereum-based blockchain infrastructure that provides the anonymous payment network for the Privacy Layer. Users of the network can also generate rewards by providing services anonymously to the network to be rewarded in CONET Token:

* Staking node for network security
* Routing node
* Network Infrastructure (ie Bitcoin node inside the CONET network)

CONET privacy infrastructure can help realize the vision Web3 hopes for.
