# Introduction

CONET created a physical virtual network infrastructure based on the Layer Minus protocol on the Internet.

Layer Minus is a virtual private network infrastructure layer on the Internet. It uses wallet addresses as identifiers for private communication, in lieu of IP addresses, once inside the network, and is also the layer that provides anonymous routing of user communications.

Whether it is ordinary Internet data, blockchain, or IoT, CONET can serve as the underlying infrastructure of the network, bringing them privacy, anonymity, and secure data communication.
