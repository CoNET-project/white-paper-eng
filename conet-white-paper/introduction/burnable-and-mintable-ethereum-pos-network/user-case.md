# User Case

Through CONET's burnable and mintable credentials, users can achieve safe transfer of assets, because there is no need for a privileged group to master a key to receive and transfer assets. With the network layer privacy of the CONET wallet address routing network, it can be achieved The following scenario.

**Ethereum 2 public chain for privacy miners**

Miners who use wallet addresses to communicate participate, allowing miners to achieve anonymous and traceless mining.

**Inherits all features of Ethereum 2**

CONET implements all the functionality of existing Ethereum 2, including Turing complete virtual machines.

**Secure and private transfers**

Burning and mintable the tree's encrypted credentials breaks the link between the sender and the recipient of the transfer. It supports CONETâ€™s native tokens and ERC20 tokens.

**Secure Cross-Chain Bridge Layer 0 infrastructure**

The assets in other blockchains can be designed to burnbale and mintable tokens. CONET can be regarded as the cross-chain layer Layer 0, a non-privileged decentralized credential verification infrastructure for secure cross-chain assets.
