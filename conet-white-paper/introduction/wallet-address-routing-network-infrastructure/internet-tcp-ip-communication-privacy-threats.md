# Internet TCP/IP Communication Privacy Threats

**Internet TCP/IP address communication privacy problems**

The TCP/IP package of the Internet communication protocol consists of header metadata including the Source address, destination IP address, and content (data) Due to the widespread use of SSL encrypted communication recommended by [W3C](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/web-https), the threat of content (data) privacy leakage is greatly reduced.

The header metadata transmitted in clear text contains the IP addresses of both communicating parties. Through IP address allocation, IANA can obtain a huge amount of information, including geographical location information of countries and regions, IP address owner information, and even the identity ID of the current tenant.

Network monitors and recipients, which can be obtained using metadata.

1. The real identity and geographical location of both parties to the communication.
2. Relevance between communication parties.
3. Communication application software types.

**Technical measures that network monitors can take**

* Traffic filtering system based on destination IP address or domain name.
* Obtain the current real geographical location of the monitored object Obtain the social network of the monitored object.
* Obtain the social network of the monitored object.
* Block network communication of a certain type of application software. Such as blocking the communication protocol of Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Internet application service providers exploit privacy**

* Obtain the visitorâ€™s true identity.
* Tailor-made advertising.
* Identity-based denial of service.
* Record and collect visitor data, combined with big data models, to obtain an accurate personal evaluation system. For example, a centralized artificial intelligence system can evaluate the user's cultural beliefs, knowledge reserves, living habits, IQ level, current happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy through big data analysis based on the accumulation of visitors' questions, and can predict the user's next step. hours, possible actions for the next week.
