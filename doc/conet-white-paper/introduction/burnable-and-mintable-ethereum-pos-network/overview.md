# Overview

CONET is a hard copy of Ethereum 2 and inherits all the features of Ethereum PoS. CONET has added the function of token burnable and mintable. In addition to the ordinary Ethereum transfer function, users can also transfer to the 0x0000 account to burn the tokens they own. One day in the future, they can recast the tokens through the recastable certificate controlled by their own wallet. To mint, the 0x0000 address transfers the burned tokens to the new wallet address.

ERC-20 tokens on the CONET chain can use the burnable and mintable feature. CONET's burnable and mintable technology can also be used as underlying credentials to become a decentralized, safe and reliable cross-chain bridge infrastructure.
