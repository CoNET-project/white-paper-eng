# Burnable and Mintable Ethereum PoS Network

In 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto first implemented a decentralized currency in practice, combining the established primitives of managing ownership through public key cryptography with a consensus algorithm that tracks who owns a coin, called "proof of work." On this basis, Ethereum proposes decentralized applications and a blockchain with built-in Turing complete programming language, which has led to the rapid development of blockchain in recent years and a large number of centralized applications on Ethereum, including decentralization. Exchanges, DeFi and game Fi, etc. As Ethereum completes PoS, it reduces the demand for computing resources and improves the scalability and efficiency of the network. The Ethereum network will carry more of the Web3 vision.&#x20;

For users who have entered the Web3 community from Web2, privacy may be the real reason for them to abandon Web2.

CONET attempts to build an Ethereum PoS network with natural privacy protection Users burn the tokens they own, and one day in the future, the burned tokens will be re-cast and put into a new wallet as a CONET Ethereum PoS network privacy solution.
