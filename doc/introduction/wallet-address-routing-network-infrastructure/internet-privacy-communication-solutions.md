# Internet Privacy Communication Solutions

Almost all existing privacy enhancement tools are based on replacing the sender IP address with the service provider IP address to hide the metadata of the real sender IP address.

**Virtual Private Network(**[**VPN**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual\_private\_network)**)**

Sender first accesses to VPN provider, then replace the source IP address to VPN provider's IP address, then start to visit the destination host IP address.&#x20;

Advantages: Seamless integration with all Internet applications.The sender hides the readl destination IP address, monitors can not knowing who the sender is communicating with and what application sender is using. Internet service providers also can not get true location of the sender. A VPN only anonymizes the sender, not the Internet service provider host.&#x20;

Disadvantages: Users cannot remain anonymous with VPN provider, also network access footprints can be recorded by the VPN provider, and VPN-specific communication protocols (fingerprint) can be intercepted by network surveillance (for example, [the Great Firewall of China ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great\_Firewall)blocks VPN protocols).

[**Tor onion network**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor\_\(network\))

Similar to VPN upgrades, the VPN that has mastered the secret is split into several parts, consisting of network entry nodes, intermediate springboards, and exit nodes. Increased difficulty in de-anonymization.

Advantages: Better privacy than VPN.

Disadvantages: Since it passes through more nodes than VPN, each node needs to decryption and encryption operations, which results in lower communication efficiency than VPN. All Tor nodes are provided by volunteers, the network's quality cannot be guaranteed and can't be used by commercial applications. Special communication protocols can be intercepted by network monitoring. Provides limited anonymity host through augmentation technology.

**Decentralized VPN (**[**dVPN**](https://clearvpn.com/blog/dvpn-vs-vpn/)**)**

The decentralized VPN service provision under the blockchain incentive mechanism inherits all the advantages and disadvantages of VPN. The workload proof mechanism promotes participants to provide high-quality services, but at the same time, allows users to be easier de-anonymized leaving hidden dangers. Blockchain-based payment systems could achieve better anonymity.

[**NYM**](https://nymtech.net/)

Nym protects internet traffic by routing it through a [decentralised mixnet](https://nymtech.net/about/mixnet) that can be accessed anonymously using zk-nyms.&#x20;

Advantages: Better privacy than VPN and Tor, decentralization under the blockchain incentive mechanism, workload proof mechanism guarantees high quality of service.

Disadvantages: Special communication protocols can be intercepted by network monitoring. The additional proof-of-work mechanism increases the cost of use and may cause the user to be deanonymized. Provides limited [anonymity host](https://nymtech.net/build/nodes?name=service\_providers) through augmentation technology.
